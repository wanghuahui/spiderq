What is spiderq?
================
Spiderq is a Web Spider to crawl webpage(html) by Qteqpid. The performance depends on your server configuration and network. I will continue maintain it and list some TODOs at the end of this file. More people are welcome to join!


Building spiderq
================
Spiderq can be compiled and used on Centos 5.8 .
Using [libevent](http://libevent.org/) to parse dns async, only support ipv4. The version is libevent-2.1.5-beta.tar.gz. 
It is as simple as:

    % make
    % make install

Then you will get an executable file named spider. After configurating spiderq.conf, run program:

    % ./spider

For more informations, see Makefile.

================
For any question, just contact me at any time. Enjoy!
